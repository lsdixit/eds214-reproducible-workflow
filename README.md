This repository contains the code for the EDS 214 class project on reproducible workflows. This project is based on the paper by Schaefer et. al., assessing the effects of hurricane disturbance on stream water concentrations in the forest watersheds of Puerto Rico. We are reproducing figure 3 from the paper and documenting our workflow.

This work is done by Leela Dixit, in collaboration with Max Czapanskiy, Alessandra Vidal Meza, with help from the students of MEDS 2026.
